Timbre Thermal Dwell Balance Estimation Tool
============================================

The timbre package enables one to calculate the required contiguous cold time to balance a specified hot observation, or
alternatively the maximum contiguous hot time yielded by a specified cold observation, for a single Xija thermal model.

The primary purpose of this package is to enable the Chandra SOT Mission Planning Team to estimate the required mix of
observations that will yield a feasible schedule, without depending on past dwell profiles that may no longer be
relevant for future schedules.
